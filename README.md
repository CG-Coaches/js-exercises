# JS Exercises

This repo contains JavaScript, TypeScript, and RxJS exercises.

The goal is to fix the Jest unit tests, by fixing the code.

## Getting started

The exercises are in the "src" folder. We tried to order them by topic.
Read the README.md in the folders, if there is one, and/or read the comments in the code.

## Solutions

Don't cheat! ;)

But if you want to see some solutions, checkout the "solutions" branch.
